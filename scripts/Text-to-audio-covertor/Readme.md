# To make the computer speak something you want, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository with `https://github.com/GDSC-RCCIIT/General-Purpose-Scripts.git`.
2. Change your working directory to the directory of this script using: `cd General-Purpose-Scripts/scripts/Text-to-audio-convertor`.
3. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the txt_to_aud.py file in terminal with `python3 txt_to_aud.py`.
5. Select the way in which you want to give the input text i.e. by typing or by extracting text from a .txt file.
7. The computer will speak the input text, just like an AI!
8. Also, the converted audio will be saved in the same directory as `voice.mp3`.
