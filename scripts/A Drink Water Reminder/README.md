# A Drink Water Reminder in Python

Hi there, today we will be talking about something very serious. We have seen most of the programmers are more concerned about their codes than their own health. As a result, we face some major health issues (for example:- Muscle Cramps, Constant Headache , decreased urine output, sleepness etc.) .” An healthy programmer is a happy programmer ” — the most effective way to keep ourselves healthy is to keep ourselves hydrated. In this article, we are going to create a ‘Drink Water’ Reminder or Notifier using Python which will remind us to drink water periodically. A few lines of code can be used to develop this notifier.

## Modules:
1. Plyer : Plyer is a platform independent module in python, that helps us to access features of our hardware / platforms. 
2. Time : There is a popular time module available in Python which provides many ways of representing time in code, such as objects, numbers, and strings.

## Approach:

Step 1: First we have to import the time module, and from plyer we will import notification .

Step 2: Second we have to call the notify method of the class. In this case, the parameters of the method is Title (title of our notification), Message (required message of our notification) and timeout (reqrequired time for displaying the message or notification , we have set it to 10).

Step 3: Finally,  we will add a sleep function to show the notification again after some time .
