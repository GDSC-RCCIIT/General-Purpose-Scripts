# Image-Compressor

A simple python command line app to compress images. It can be used to seamlessly compress and decompress images in .png, .bmp, .tiff, .git, .exif and other image formats. Does not have .jpg support as they are already highly compressed.

cd General-Purpose-Scripts/image-compressor
