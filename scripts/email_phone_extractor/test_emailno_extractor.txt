I once visited my grandma who used to live in the city of New Delhi, India back in the summer of 2013. That's where I was introduced to emails. My first email created was jumpingsnake@gmail.com. Then I created dumdumdigadiga@yahoo.com. Until in 2017, when I got my phone with the credentials 8709790890.

Lately, I feel I should get a number like +9187093152345
