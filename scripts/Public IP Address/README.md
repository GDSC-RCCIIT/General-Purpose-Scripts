It is a python code to make a request to [http://checkip.dyndns.org](http://checkip.dyndns.org), which in turn send a response back with your External IP address.

This response is in HTML so it also extracts only useful information from it and prints it as an output.

* open the `Public IP Address` folder
* run `python my_public_ip.py`
* You just recieved your public IP.
