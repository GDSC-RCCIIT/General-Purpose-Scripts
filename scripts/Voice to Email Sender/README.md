# EmailBot

The bot accepts your voice commands and sends or copies email to clipboard on behalf of you.
Text file "userEmails.txt" will add your emails to it on the first time you enter your email manually, which will allow you to send email without typing your emails manually again and again.

**Note:** 
- You need to turn on "Less Secure app access" for sender's google account to send emails. [Turn it on](https://myaccount.google.com/u/1/lesssecureapps?gar=1&pli=1&rapt=AEjHL4OoFmCuh64yQ0ouHrp3Evvsn5IxGRPlm8HOiwPPhdXMps529Xu09pfkLE8LdSgVUy07MNr30VvVziCGMS8pQZl4NI-X6A)
