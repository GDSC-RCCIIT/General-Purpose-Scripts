# Password Leak Checker
> This python script will allow you to check if your password has been
> compromised in any other data breaches.
> This is the simple way of checking how strong is your password.

## Why use this
This script sends first 5 characters of the password and fetches the full list of passwords that were breached starting from those first 5 letters this way you don't need to send your full password and can get the appropriate data locally that is why this script is more secure than manually going to the website and typing out your password.

To install it, type
```
pip3 install requests
```
### How to run

```
python3 script.py <Your-Password>
